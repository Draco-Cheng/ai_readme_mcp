# Stack Evaluation: TypeScript vs Python

## Context
- The MCP server will run as a standalone automation utility, consuming repositories and generating AI_README files patterned after [`sample/AI_README.md`](sample/AI_README.md:1).
- The tool must scan arbitrary directory trees, detect layered AI_README scopes, and rewrite documentation without assuming an Nx workspace or predefined tech stack.
- Distribution should be frictionless for Roo Code users who primarily execute Node.js-based MCP servers today.

## TypeScript (Node.js) Implementation
### Advantages
- The official MCP SDK ships first-class TypeScript typings, runtime helpers, and actively maintained examples, reducing boilerplate for transport, schema validation, and logging.
- Node.js is already embedded in Roo Code installations, allowing the server to run with zero additional runtime setup for most users.
- Popular ecosystem packages (`globby`, `fs-extra`, `picocolors`) streamline cross-platform filesystem traversal, diffing, and CLI feedback.
- Packaging is straightforward: build once with `tsc` and optionally bundle into a single executable with `esbuild` or `pkg` for distribution.
- JSON Schema generation for configuration contracts can reuse TypeScript interfaces, keeping guidance consistent across tooling.

### Considerations
- Requires compilation (TypeScript â†’ JavaScript), though an npm `build` script fully automates the step.
- Users without Node.js would need to install it, but this is uncommon for Roo Code workflows.

## Python Implementation
### Advantages
- Extensive standard library support for filesystem operations and templating.
- Simple scripting experience for users already invested in Python tooling.

### Considerations
- The Python MCP SDK currently has fewer production-grade references, increasing ramp-up time and maintenance risk.
- Packaging a Python MCP server demands virtual environment management or tools like `shiv`/`pex`, complicating distribution.
- Async orchestration (needed for responsive MCP tooling) introduces additional ceremony via `asyncio` and platform-specific subprocess handling.
- Integration with JavaScript-focused AI workflows would still require bridging layers or separate tooling.

## Recommendation
Adopt a TypeScript implementation. It minimizes operational friction for Roo Code users, aligns with actively supported MCP tooling, and provides the most direct path to distributing a single binary or npm package for the standalone server.

## Next Steps
- Scaffold the Node.js project (`package.json`, [`tsconfig.json`](tsconfig.json:1), [`src/index.ts`](src/index.ts:1)) and establish build scripts.
- Design reusable modules for AI_README discovery, aggregation, templating, and write-back logic.
- Produce setup and usage documentation in [`README.md`](README.md:1), including MCP settings configuration and distribution guidance.
